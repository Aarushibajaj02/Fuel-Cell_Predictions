# Predictive Modeling with Fuel Cell Performance Data

This repository contains the implementation of predictive modeling on the Fuel_cell_performance dataset. The analysis focuses on dividing the dataset into specific target groups based on roll numbers and evaluating multiple machine learning models.

Since the Roll number is 102203820 i.e. ending with 0 so target variable is target1.
